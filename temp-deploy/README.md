# Research Collab Application

A platform for researchers to connect, collaborate, and share their research.

## Deployment

The application is currently deployed at:
https://research-collab-l9aowzxsm-shreyanshrath4-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app

## Authentication Options

The application supports multiple authentication methods:

### Email/Password Login
Users can sign in using their email and password credentials. This is the most traditional authentication method.

### OAuth Providers
The application supports authentication with:
- Google
- GitHub

### Guest Login
The application features a streamlined guest login that requires no credentials. This allows users to explore the platform without creating an account. Guest users have access to a limited dashboard and can browse research posts.

## Redirect Handling

All authentication methods properly handle the `redirectTo` query parameter. If you access the login page with a `redirectTo` parameter (e.g., `/login?redirectTo=/research`), you'll be redirected to the specified page after successful login.

## Setup Supabase Authentication

To ensure authentication works properly, you need to configure the Supabase project with the correct redirect URLs:

1. Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
4. Set the Site URL to match your production deployment URL:
   ```
   https://research-collab-l9aowzxsm-shreyanshrath4-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
   ```
5. Add the following Additional Redirect URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/**
   https://research-collab-l9aowzxsm-shreyanshrath4-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/**
   ```
   
The `**` wildcard ensures that redirects work for all paths in your application.

## Features

## Tech Stack

- Next.js for the frontend and API routes
- Supabase for authentication and database
- React with hooks and context (Zustand) for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Real-time subscriptions for chat and notifications

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
